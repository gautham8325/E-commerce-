## Project Overview

This project is a full-fledged e-commerce website built with NextJS. Inspired by a UI design by [Anton Mikhaltsov](https://dribbble.com/shots/9404340-Shop-Clothing-Web-Page), I developed it within a week as a personal challenge. Some features are still in progress, and improvements are planned.

### Key Features:
- Firebase integration for backend services
- Product listing with categories and cart functionality
- Responsive layout (currently being worked on)
- Authentication and form handling with React Hook Form

### Built With:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
